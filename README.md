# Fivem-Proxy-Install.sh
Handy script to install nginx as a proxy for your FiveM/RedM server.

## Why ?
As I own [purplemaze](https://purplemaze.xyz), an anti-DDoS protection for FiveM, I needed to generate some proxy by hand, and I thought it would be a good idea to automate the process.  
Additionally, some people were asking me how to do it, so I decided to make a script to help them.

2. Make it executable: `chmod +x fivem-proxy-install.sh`

1. Follow the instructions
